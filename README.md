### Final Tips Before Publishing
- **Add a good README image/screenshot** at the top (use lightshot or browser screenshot → crop nicely)  
- **Create a simple favicon** (emoji 🌙 or 🎧 in favicon.io)  
- **Deploy it** for free: Vercel (easiest), Netlify, or GitHub Pages  
- **Add topics/tags** on GitHub: react, tailwindcss, vite, mood-tracker, ambient-music, aesthetic, web-app  
- **Star it yourself** and share on X / Reddit if you want feedback

What name/description combo are you leaning toward?  
Or want me to tweak the README more (e.g. add deployment steps, license badge, etc.)? 🚀
